        <p>In this lecture, I gained insights into the basic concepts of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet is a network of computers communicating through the Internet Protocol (IP), while the WWW is the part of the Internet we access via websites. I also learned about Tim Berners-Lee's role in creating the WWW, along with the growth of major companies like Amazon, Google, and Yahoo during the dot-com era and the subsequent crash.</p>
        <p>The Internetâ€™s architecture is built on open standards, allowing devices to join and leave networks freely, with minimal central control. The OSI model was explained, showing how data moves through layers, starting from physical hardware to application-level interactions like web browsing and emails.</p>

        <p>Web development is one of the most exciting fields in technology today. The combination of front-end and back-end technologies creates the dynamic and interactive web pages we use every day. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the backbone of front-end development, while server-side technologies like PHP and Node.js manage data on the back-end.</p>
        <p>In modern web development, frameworks such as React and Angular are widely used to create fast and efficient user interfaces. As developers, we need to keep up with the latest trends to stay competitive in this constantly evolving field.</p>
